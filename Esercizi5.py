# Create a Playlist:Write a function called create_playlist() that accepts a playlist name and a variable number of song titles
#The function should return a dictionary with the playlist name and a set of songs. Call the function with different numbers of
#songs to demonstrate flexibility.
#Example: create_playlist("Road Trip", {"Song 1", "Song 2"})
#Write a function called add_like() that accepts a dictionary, the name of a playlist, and a boolean value indicating whether it is liked (True or False). This function should return an updated dictionary.
#Example: add_like(dictionary, “Road Trip”, liked=True)
